# Ender3Monitor

A 3D print failure detection system that watches your printer through a USB webcam, uses AI vision to spot problems in real time, fires email alerts when something goes wrong, and records a timelapse of every print.

Supports two AI backends: **Claude** (Anthropic API) and **llava:7b** (Ollama, free, runs locally on your machine).

---

## Features

- **Live failure detection** — analyzes a frame on a configurable interval (default 60s; the main cost dial)
- **Detects six failure types** — spaghetti/stringing, layer shifts, bed detachment, stopped extrusion, nozzle collisions, and warping
- **Frame pre-validation** — OpenCV checks brightness, contrast, and edge density before sending to AI; rejects dark, covered, or off-target frames without burning API calls
- **Print completion detection** — uses the printer's own status over USB when available (stops exactly when the print finishes); falls back to camera stillness (4 consecutive still frames) when no printer is connected
- **Printer control over USB** — live nozzle/bed temps, print progress and time remaining, auto-pause/cooldown on a confirmed failure, and manual pause/resume/cooldown/e-stop from the dashboard
- **Hands-off start** — auto-starts monitoring when the printer begins a print (USB), and gates warmup on real signals (waits until printing has started and heaters are at target) instead of a fixed timer; falls back to a timer without USB
- **First-layer inspection** — analyzes more frequently with an adhesion/squish focus during the failure-prone first layer (uses USB Z height)
- **Layer-synced timelapse** — captures one frame per layer (via USB Z) for a smooth, consistent timelapse; falls back to time-based without USB
- **Auto completion report** — on finish, sends stats + final photo + the timelapse video to Telegram
- **Interactive Telegram bot** — two-way control and `/ask` natural-language questions about the live print ("is the first layer sticking?")
- **Maintenance tracking** — cumulative print hours with upkeep reminders and a "possible clog" heads-up when stopped-extrusion recurs
- **Push notifications** — instant phone alerts via ntfy, Discord, or Telegram
- **Email alerts** — SMTP notification with failure type, confidence score, and attached snapshot
- **Web UI** — clean dark-theme dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`; start/stop monitoring, live camera feed, confidence gauge, AI observations, and event log
- **CLI** — terminal interface with live status line if you prefer to run headless
- **Prometheus metrics** — `/metrics` endpoint for frames analyzed, failure counts by type, and confidence score trends
- **Grafana dashboard** — pre-built JSON ready to import
- **Timelapse** — saves a frame every 30 seconds and compiles to a downloadable MP4 on demand
- **Multi-camera support** — auto-detects cameras, opens Preview snapshots so you can visually identify which index maps to your printer

## Choosing an AI backend

### Option A — Anthropic (Claude)

Best accuracy. Requires an API key and costs ~$0.40–1.00/hr depending on resolution.

```
ANALYZER_BACKEND=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### Option B — Ollama (free, local)

Runs entirely on your machine — no API key, no ongoing cost.

**Install Ollama:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install ollama
brew services start ollama

# or download from https://ollama.com
```

**Pull the recommended model:**
```bash
ollama pull llava:7b    # ~4.1 GB download
```

**Set in `.env`:**
```
ANALYZER_BACKEND=ollama
OLLAMA_MODEL=llava:7b
```

**Model guide for 8 GB RAM (e.g. M2 MacBook Air):**

| Model | Size | Fits in 8 GB? | Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| `llava:7b` | ~4.1 GB | ✅ Recommended | Good |
| `moondream` | ~1.4 GB | ✅ Easily | Limited |
| `llama3.2-vision:11b` | ~6.2 GB | ⚠️ Will swap | Better |

`llava:7b` is the best balance — fits alongside macOS overhead and uses the M2 GPU via Metal. Consider raising `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` to `0.80` with Ollama, as local models can be overconfident.

---

## Email alerts (optional)

Alerts are sent via SMTP when a failure is detected above the confidence threshold, and again when a print is detected as complete.

### Gmail setup

Gmail requires an App Password when 2FA is enabled:

1. Go to **Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords**
2. Generate a password for "Mail"
3. Use that 16-character password as `SMTP_PASSWORD`
4. Set `SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com` and `SMTP_PORT=587`

---

## Running the app

### Web UI (recommended)

```bash
python web.py
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser. The dashboard shows:
- Live camera snapshot (refreshes every 10 seconds)
- Confidence gauge with colour coding (green → amber → red)
- Current failure type and AI observation
- Frame and failure counters
- Start / Stop / Compile Timelapse buttons
- Event log of every analysed frame

### CLI

```bash
python monitor.py
```

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `start` | Open the camera and begin monitoring |
| `stop` | Stop monitoring |
| `timelapse` | Compile saved frames into an MP4 |
| `status` | Print current status and last result |
| `quit` | Stop and exit |

Live status line while monitoring:
```
  [14:23:01] Status: Monitoring…            | Frames:   12 | Failures:   0 | Confidence: 8.3% | Type: none
             Print progressing normally. First layer adhering well to bed.
```

### Camera selection

If `CAMERA_INDEX=-1` (the default), the app will detect all cameras, save a snapshot thumbnail from each to `/tmp/`, and open them in Preview (macOS) so you can see which index maps to which physical camera. Set `CAMERA_INDEX` in `.env` once confirmed to skip the prompt on future runs.

## Prometheus & Grafana (optional)

### 1. Install Prometheus

```bash
brew install prometheus
```

Edit `/opt/homebrew/etc/prometheus.yml` and add the scrape job:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: ender3monitor
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']
```

Start Prometheus:
```bash
brew services start prometheus
# Dashboard at http://localhost:9090
```

### 2. Install Grafana

```bash
brew install grafana
brew services start grafana
# Dashboard at http://localhost:3000
# Default login: admin / admin
```

### 3. Connect Grafana to Prometheus

1. Open **http://localhost:3000**
2. Go to **Connections → Data Sources → Add data source**
3. Choose **Prometheus**
4. Set URL to `http://localhost:9090`
5. Click **Save & Test**

### 4. Import the dashboards

1. Go to **Dashboards → Import**
2. Upload from this repo (repeat for each):
   - `grafana/dashboard.json` — **print monitoring** (frames, failures, confidence)
   - `grafana/printer_dashboard.json` — **printer telemetry** (temps, progress, Z, lifetime)
   - `grafana/web_dashboard.json` — **web app / SRE** (HTTP latency, system, internals)
3. Select your Prometheus data source when prompted
4. Click **Import**

### Print-monitoring metrics

You can verify the metrics endpoint is working before setting up Prometheus:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
```

## Telegram control

Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, and `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHATS` (chat IDs allowed to issue commands — your alert channel's ID works) to control the printer from anywhere, with no exposed web server. Commands:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/status` | Monitoring state, temps, progress, lifetime hours |
| `/ask <question>` | Ask the AI about the live frame (e.g. `/ask is the first layer sticking?`) |
| `/snapshot` | Live camera photo |
| `/pause` `/resume` `/cooldown` | Printer control over USB |
| `/go` `/stop` | Start / stop monitoring |
| `/autostart on\|off` | Toggle auto-start-on-print |
| `/maintenance` | Print hours + upkeep status |
| `/help` | List commands |

On completion the bot also auto-sends a report: stats, final photo, and the timelapse video.

### Running the tests

```bash
pip install pytest
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
```

Covers the parsing/decision logic: AI response normalization, G-code reply
regexes (M105/M27/M31/M114/M78), frame pre-checks and motion diff, camera-flip
parsing, and maintenance persistence/alerts.

## How it works

1. Monitoring starts automatically when the printer begins a print (USB, `AUTO_START_ON_PRINT`), or manually via the UI/CLI/Telegram. During warmup, analysis is gated on real signals — it waits until the print has started and the heaters reach target (a fixed timer is used as a fallback without USB)
2. A background thread wakes up every `CAPTURE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 300s; tighter during the first layer) and captures a single frame, then releases the camera
3. Three fast OpenCV pre-checks run locally (brightness, contrast, edge density) — frames that are too dark, featureless, or not aimed at a printer are rejected without an API call
4. Valid frames are sent to Claude or llava:7b with a structured prompt; the model returns JSON with `failure_detected`, `failure_type`, `confidence`, and `description`
5. If confidence ≥ `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` and a real failure is detected, an email alert is sent with the frame attached
6. Completion is detected from the printer's USB status when connected (monitoring stops the moment the print finishes); otherwise it falls back to camera stillness (4 consecutive still frames). Near the end, failure flagging is suppressed so the parked print head isn't mistaken for a gap/stopped-extrusion failure
7. Every 30 seconds a frame is saved for the timelapse
8. All results are pushed to Prometheus metrics in real time and broadcast to connected web UI clients via WebSocket
